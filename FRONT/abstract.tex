\chapter{Abstract}

This dissertation provides some guidance on the use of \LaTeX\ in the
production of a dissertation. It is intended to serve as an
illustration of some basic \LaTeX\ commands and the use of the
\texttt{thesis.cls} file.  The structure of the dissertation, the
organisation and naming of directories and files and the content of
the chapters is illustrative only.  You should modify all these
aspects to suit your own requirements. It is assumed that you are
working with a modern \LaTeX\ installation that includes packages such
as \texttt{natbib}, \texttt{url} and \texttt{graphicx}.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}
  My supervisor is an exceptional chap without whom this dissertation
  would have been possible. The University should bestow upon him
  immediately the title of Professor and adjust his remuneration
  accordingly.

  Other people, too, have been quite helpful in getting me to this
  stage in my career.

	\chapter{Introduction}
	Now that the relevant product fields are understood to a sufficient degree and the product's needs have been established we can begin to plan out how we will achieve the project's objectives. First we will established the methological approach that will structure the product's development. We will then look into the basic design that is needed to achieve the different product requirements. This will allow the actual implementation to begin, and once that is complete appropriate tests will be taken out to ensure that the needs have been properly met.
	
	\chapter{Methological Approach}
	The project employed a prototyping methodology for development. This involves the system requirements being outlined and understood with an initial design being created from these requirements. Following this the first prototype is built, which often resembles an incredibly basic scaled down version of how the final system should ideally look. This prototype is then thoroughly evaluated, with potential changes that would bring the prototype closer to the final system being figured out. Finally, these changes are then implemented and the prototype is evaluated once again. This is repeated until the product has reached its ultimate goals.

	This was employed partially due to the hardware nature of the product. Key features of the robot hinged on aspects like movement and observation being possible, so it was important to get a prototype that has this basic functionality up and working and quickly as possible. The prototyping approach allowed a pure focus on getting these functions working, and once they were the robot could be improved iteratively.

			\subsubsection{Hardware}
			As described previously in the Analysis, the foundation of the robot's structure is the three wheeled omnidirectional chassis. This will provide some of the fundamentals needed to achieve a moving chassis, chiefly the chassis itself as well as motors to drive the omni directional wheels, as well as a structure which can house the other components such as the power supply and the microcontroller which will dictate the motors.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}
	\section{Background}
	This project aims to develop a ground based mobile robotic platform capable of self navigation and mapping. This will allow it to be used for the navigation and exploration of unknown areas.
	
	Exploration and autonomous robotics have went hand in hand for a while now. Programs such as Voyager have resulted in the development of unmanned craft that has set out to try and explore places not humanly accessible so that they may be understood. Unmanned exploration is not restricted to outer space however, with caves\citep{mcfarlane2013integrated} and deep sea sinkholes\citep{carnegie2007sinkhole} being explored with unmanned craft as well. The ability to map environments isn't even specific to exploration either. As the technology behind this has advanced, consumer level products have become available that employ these technologies. Vacuum cleaners are available in stores capable of mapping and navigating around the houses they clean to ensure they have proper coverage of rooms.
	
	These autonomous machines have provided an unparalleled level of potential, as they allow for the incredibly accurate measurement of environments whilst also removing aspects such as risks to human life. No longer are these robots things seen in only science fiction. Now you can have one cleaning your living room.
	
	This project aims to develop a product that implements this kind of self-navigational and mapping functionality. A mobile platform will be created that uses range finding technology that enables it to observe its surrounding environment. With these observations, the robot should navigate around areas avoiding obstacles whilst simultaneously mapping the area.
	
	In order to discover the way in which this will be implemented, several different key aspects will need to be explored. These aspects pertain to the construction of a mobile platform, what hardware the platform will utilise to fulfill its desired functionality (most notably what will be used for observation), and how the observational data that is acquired can be turned into a map.

	\section{Objectives}
	The main objectives of the project are as follows
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Investigate Mobile Robotics - In order to determine how the platform will be created
		\item Investigate Robotic Mapping - To determine how the robot's mapping will be achieved
		\item Propose Requirements - To help provide goals for development
		\item Develop - Build the mobile platform and any appropriate software needed to fulfill requirements
		\item Test - Test the hardware and software components of the developed product
		\item Evaluate - Evaluate the product and the process undertaken to create it
	\end{itemize}

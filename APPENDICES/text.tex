						Test & Test Purpose & Expected Result & Actual Result & Pass/Fail & Comments \\ [0.5ex] 
						\hline
						Drive Forward & The robot should move forwards during its operation & As expected & The robot moved forwards when it was switched on & Pass & Hardcoded movement  \\
						
						Drive Right & The robot should move right during its operation & The robot is able to move right & The robot couldn't move right & Fail &   \\
						
						Drive Left & The robot should move left during its operation & The robot is able to move left & The robot couldn't move left & Fail &   \\
						
						Motor Obstructions & During the previous drive tests, there should be no obstructions to the motors from the robot's other components & As expected & The robot's motors didnt get blocked & Pass &   \\
						
						Scanning & The robot should stop to scan & The robot stops and scans its environment & As predicteda & Pass &   \\ 
						
						Write Scan Data & Ensure the robot can write scanned data to the Micro SD-Card & The Micro SD-Card will contain a file with scan data & As expected & Pass & Plugged in and viewed with USB adapter  \\
						 
						Writing Duration & Ensure the robot writes data to the Micro-SD Card in a reasonable time  & Writing should be done in under ten seconds & Writing was done in under ten seconds & Pass & Ready light flashed indicating writing task was finished  \\ 
						
						Generate Map & Using the robot's scan data, the GUI should produce a basic map & Map will be produced resembling the robot's environment & Map was produced but didn't resemble the environment & Fail &  \\ 
						
						Generate Map Without File & Make the GUI attempt to generate a map without an available file & GUI will catch and handle a runtime exception & As expected & Pass &  \\ 
						
						Map Multiple Areas & Mapping should work on multiple different environments & Each map will be accurate to the environment the robot was in & Maps didn't resemble the environment & Fail &  \\ 
						
						Repeated Mapping & Repeated maps of the same area should look similar & Map will be produced resembling the robot's environment & Maps didn't resemble the environment & Fail &  \\ 
						
						SLAM & The system should be capable of producing a dynamic map using multiple scans from different locations & The GUI creates a map from the robot's scan data & No such functionality & Fail &  \\ [1ex]
